Here are some suggestions for data visualizations and talking points you can prepare to strengthen your proposal for continued funding. The goal is to clearly show both the technical feasibility and the business impact of your ultrasonic object-detection project.

1. Show Model Performance Improvements
	1.	Accuracy / mAP Over Time
	•	Why? Demonstrate tangible improvements in the core metric (e.g., mean Average Precision, or mAP) across multiple training iterations or epochs.
	•	Graph Idea: A simple line chart plotting mAP (or precision/recall) on the y-axis vs. training epochs or versions on the x-axis.
	•	Talking Point: Emphasize how each iteration has led to improvements, showcasing incremental gains that justify further investment.
	2.	Precision-Recall Curve
	•	Why? Helps stakeholders see how the model balances precision (fewer false positives) and recall (fewer missed detections).
	•	Graph Idea: A typical precision-recall curve for different model checkpoints or hyperparameter tuning rounds.
	•	Talking Point: Demonstrate that you can fine-tune thresholds based on business needs (e.g., high precision if false alarms are costly, or high recall if missed detections are unacceptable).
	3.	Confusion Matrix
	•	Why? Even though confusion matrices are more commonly used for classification problems, a simplified version can show true positives vs. false positives/negatives for each ultrasonic object class.
	•	Graph Idea: A heatmap table that highlights correct detections vs. misclassifications among key classes (or object types).
	•	Talking Point: Emphasize which classes the model excels at detecting and which ones need more data or specialized fine-tuning.

2. Demonstrate Business Value
	1.	ROI / Cost-Benefit Analysis
	•	Why? Management needs to understand the business impact, not just technical metrics.
	•	Graph Idea: A bar chart or table that compares estimated costs (e.g., hardware, annotation time, R&D) with projected savings/revenue increases from the model (e.g., reduced manual inspections, faster turnaround times, fewer errors).
	•	Talking Point: Show a clear path to ROI—e.g., “By reducing false negatives by X%, we cut rework costs by Y%,” or “Automating detection saves Z hours per week, translating to $___ in cost savings.”
	2.	Timeline of Key Milestones
	•	Why? Illustrate progress and timeline to deliver future features, so leadership sees when real-world deployment could happen.
	•	Graph Idea: A Gantt chart or milestone chart showing completed stages (data collection, annotation, training) and upcoming stages (production deployment, scaling, feature improvements).
	•	Talking Point: Demonstrate you have a clear roadmap and timeline. Show that the project is organized and that further investment will accelerate results.
	3.	Risk-Reward Matrix
	•	Why? Management often weighs project risks against potential rewards.
	•	Graph Idea: A simple matrix with “Risk Level” on one axis and “Reward/Impact” on the other. Position your ultrasonic detection project high on the “Reward” axis and moderate on the “Risk” axis.
	•	Talking Point: Emphasize mitigated risks (use of proven architectures like Faster R-CNN, incremental improvements, small pilot deployments) versus the high reward in productivity gains or new lines of business.

3. Highlight Operational and Strategic Advantages
	1.	Comparison with Existing or Manual Processes
	•	Why? Show how the model outperforms or speeds up current methods.
	•	Chart Idea: A table or bar chart comparing accuracy, time-per-inspection, or cost-per-inspection between the manual process vs. your ML model.
	•	Talking Point: Quantify how many hours (or dollars) can be saved per week/month/year, and mention improvements in safety or compliance that result from automated ultrasonic detection.
	2.	Scalability & Future Use Cases
	•	Why? Leadership wants to know if the system can be extended or repurposed.
	•	Visualization Idea: A roadmap of potential expansions (e.g., new product lines, additional object classes, integrating with other sensors).
	•	Talking Point: Point out that once the model is robust, it can be applied to multiple scenarios—explosive detection, industrial inspection, quality control, etc.
	3.	Workflow Diagram of the Deployment Pipeline
	•	Why? Show the “big picture” from data ingestion to real-time detection on the production line (or in the field).
	•	Diagram Idea: A high-level flow illustrating how data is collected from ultrasonic sensors, fed into the Faster R-CNN model, and then integrated into a QA system or alerting dashboard.
	•	Talking Point: Emphasize the streamlined approach and how you’ve set up a repeatable pipeline that can continuously improve (CI/CD for ML).

4. Address Potential Concerns Proactively
	1.	Explain Model Interpretability / Explainability
	•	Why? Leadership wants to trust AI solutions.
	•	Visualization Idea: Examples of detection overlays on ultrasonic images—before and after improvements.
	•	Talking Point: Show bounding box predictions and highlight exactly what the model “sees.” This helps build trust in the algorithm and justifies spending on further improvements.
	2.	Outline a Risk Mitigation Strategy
	•	Why? Any new technology project has risks—technical, operational, or compliance-related.
	•	Diagram Idea: A bubble chart or list highlighting each major risk (e.g., data collection challenges, hardware malfunctions) and how you plan to mitigate (e.g., data augmentation, sensor redundancy).
	•	Talking Point: Demonstrate that you have a plan for data security, edge cases, and worst-case scenarios. This reduces perceived risk for management.

5. Summarize Key Takeaways
	•	Technical Feasibility:
Show charts that prove the model’s performance (mAP, precision, recall) and that it keeps improving with more data or better hyperparameters.
	•	Business Justification:
Back up the performance gains with ROI, cost savings, and time savings. Show a clear timeline and future expansions.
	•	Risk Management:
Present visualizations or bullet points that demonstrate you’ve anticipated potential hurdles and have strategies to overcome them.
	•	Actionable Next Steps:
Make it obvious what additional funding will be used for—more data, better annotation tooling, compute resources, more frequent model iterations, pilot tests in real-world conditions, etc.

Putting It All Together

When you present, consider weaving these visuals into a compelling narrative:
	1.	Start with the problem your ultrasonic detection is solving (why it matters to the organization).
	2.	Show the technical progress (performance charts, confusion matrices).
	3.	Highlight the business impact (ROI graph, cost-saving chart, timeline for rollout).
	4.	Address potential risks and show you’ve prepared for them.
	5.	Conclude with a request for funding tied directly to the next set of improvements and corresponding business benefits.

By combining clear, data-driven charts with a concrete business case, you’re more likely to get buy-in from stakeholders who care about the bottom line as well as the technical viability of your Faster R-CNN ultrasonic project. Good luck with your pitch!
